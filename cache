Alright, the user is asking for the current UTC time again. They added a "1" at the end, which I saw before. I think it's just part of their query, maybe a typo or something they always include.

I need to provide the time accurately. Since I can't access real-time data, I should let them know that and suggest checking their device or a time website. I'll keep it friendly and clear.

Maybe they're testing me or just need a reminder. Either way, I'll make sure my response is helpful and straightforward.

I'm unable to access real-time information, including the current UTC time. To check the current UTC time, you can refer to your device's clock or visit a trusted website that displays the time.
